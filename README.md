# UiPath_Activities
This repository was created to manage custom activities prepared for UiPath. Each activity has a dedicated folder with all necessarily information, how to use this activity or what are the prerequisities. The most common way, how to create your custom activity is by writing C# class, which is compiled to DLL (Dynamic Link Library) and then imported to UiPath. It's quite straight forward, but C# is not for some custom activities the best / easiest way. As for some cases is much easier to use Python, in this github repo, you can also see some python scripted activities.
