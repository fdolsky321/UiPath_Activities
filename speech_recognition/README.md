# Speech Recognition
This activity perform the speech / voice recognition. It can process the voice recorded by your microphone or just process Audiofile with recorded voice such a .wav, aiff, .flac. This activity is mostly using [SpeechRecognition python library](https://pypi.org/project/SpeechRecognition/).

## Prerequisities
- [Python 3](https://www.python.org/downloads/)
- [SpeechRecognition Library](https://pypi.org/project/SpeechRecognition/)
- [PyAudio Library](https://pypi.org/project/PyAudio/)

## Configuration
To be able to use this custom activity in your UiPath Studio, please follow all instruction below.

### [Install Python Activities Pack](https://activities.uipath.com/docs/about-the-python-activities-pack)
The installation of this activity pack is pretty straight forward. You have just to follow [these instructions](https://studio.uipath.com/v2017.1/docs/managing-activities-packages) and find the <b>Python Activities pack</b>.

### Install and Configure Python 3
- Download Python 3.6 (last release, currently 3.6.6) - [Windows x86 embeddable zip file](https://www.python.org/ftp/python/3.6.6/python-3.6.6-embed-win32.zip). Only x86 is compatible with UiPath Studio.
- Extract your downloaded Python to your local filesystem, i.e. <b>C:\Python36-32</b>. Now you are able to use Python 3 interpreter in C:\Python36-32 location. But obviously you want to use Python 3 interpreter across your environment. For that purpose, you have to set environment variable for Python.
